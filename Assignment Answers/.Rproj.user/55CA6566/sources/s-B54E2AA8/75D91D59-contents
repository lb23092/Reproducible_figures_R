## QUESTION 01: Data Visualisation for Science Communication

*Create a figure using the Palmer Penguin dataset that is correct but badly communicates the data. **Do not make a boxplot**.*

### a) Provide your figure here:

```{r bad figure code, echo=FALSE}
misleading_graph <-ggplot(penguins_clean_Q1, aes(x = culmen_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(size =1, alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Culmen depth (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)", title = "The relationship between Culmen depth and Body mass in Palmer Penguins")+
  ylim(0,6000) +
  theme_bw()
  
  misleading_graph
```

### b) Write about how your design choices mislead the reader about the underlying data (200-300 words).

Although this figure is technically correct, it is intentionally misleading. One of the ways I've achieved this is by setting the x-axis limits between 0 and 6000. Given that we are studying penguins, they are unlikely to have a body mass less than 2000, so making the axis cover such a large range gives the impression that it varies less than it actually does when taken in context. However, the main issue with this graph relates to Simpson's Paradox (Ameringer 2010 and references therin). Simpson's paradox is a statistical phenomenon whereby a trend present in different subsets of data dissapears or reverses when the groups are combined. According to the graph I have produced and its linear regression line shown in black, there is a negative correlation between Culmen depth and Body Mass. However, when you subset the data into the different penguin species - Adelie, Gentoo and Chrinstrap - the correlation between these variables is actually positive. My aestetic choices may also cause confusion. For example, I have made my points small and transparent making them difficult to interpret. Furthermore, the fact that the linear regression line is black could cause issues. They are usually a bright colour to provide high contrast from the other data points.

## QUESTION 2: Data Pipeline

*Write a data analysis pipeline in your .rmd RMarkdown file. You should be aiming to write a clear explanation of the steps, the figures visible, as well as clear code.*

*Your code should include the steps practiced in the lab session:*

-   *Load the data*

-   *Appropriately clean the data*

-   *Create an Exploratory Figure (**not a boxplot**)*

-   *Save the figure*

-   ***New**: Run a statistical test*

-   ***New**: Create a Results Figure*

-   *Save the figure*

*An exploratory figure shows raw data, such as the distribution of the data. A results figure demonstrates the stats method chosen, and includes the results of the stats test.*

*Between your code, communicate clearly what you are doing and why.*

*Your text should include:*

-   *Introduction*

-   *Hypothesis*

-   *Stats Method*

-   *Results*

-   *Discussion*

-   *Conclusion*

*You will be marked on the following:*

### a) Your code for readability and functionality

### b) Your figures for communication

### c) Your text communication of your analysis

*Below is a template you can use.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

```{r Data Exploration}

# Make sure your code prints. 

```

### Hypothesis

### Statistical Methods

```{r Statistics}

# Make sure your code prints. 

```

### Results & Discussion

```{r Plotting Results}

# Make sure your code prints. 

```

### Conclusion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## QUESTION 3: Open Science

### a) GitHub

*Upload your RProject you created for **Question 2** and any files and subfolders used to GitHub. Do not include any identifiers such as your name. Make sure your GitHub repo is public.*

*GitHub link:*

*You will be marked on your repo organisation and readability.*

### b) Share your repo with a partner, download, and try to run their data pipeline.

*Partner's GitHub link:*

*You **must** provide this so I can verify there is no plagiarism between you and your partner.*

### c) Reflect on your experience running their code. (300-500 words)

-   *What elements of your partner's code helped you to understand their data pipeline?*

-   *Did it run? Did you need to fix anything?*

-   *What suggestions would you make for improving their code to make it more understandable or reproducible, and why?*

-   *If you needed to alter your partner's figure using their code, do you think that would be easy or difficult, and why?*

### d) Reflect on your own code based on your experience with your partner's code and their review of yours. (300-500 words)

-   *What improvements did they suggest, and do you agree?*

-   *What did you learn about writing code for other people?*
